# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
- I have a strong fluency with them, I have experience with them in past coding courses, and I feel very confident in my ability to use them, and use them properly. 
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
-Also feel strong and confident about them. I believe so far it has been my strongest category / section in Mod 0.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
-If statements can get complex really fast, but I feel like I have the basics down, I tend to get confused on whether a function or if statement is better as sometimes it feel interchangeable, but I feel confident on the basics. 
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
-I breezed through this category, I believe it was less than an hour but more than half an hour. About half the time for every other section. 
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that? 
- I will use the if statements more, but that is more what I need practice on, I'm sure that the comparisons will get more complex too, but I can't imagine a situation now that would be too complex, but I know the if statements are more for training. 
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

- Mainly when to use function, if, or for statement. Seems like they can all meet in the middle, but to be the most efficient I am not sure how to do it.
